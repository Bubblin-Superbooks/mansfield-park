A happy party it appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound which did not make her cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should forget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the meadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a foot&rsquo;s pace; then, at her apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter; and to Fanny&rsquo;s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely.</p></div> </div>
