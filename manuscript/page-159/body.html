<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but one style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than&mdash;&lsquo;Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything as usual. Yours sincerely.&rsquo; That is the true manly style; that is a complete brother&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
