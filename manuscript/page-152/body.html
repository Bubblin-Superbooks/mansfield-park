I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You would know what you were about, of course; but that would not suit me. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are before me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as much beauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till it was complete.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
