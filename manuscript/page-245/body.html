I thought that was always the lot of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never is a black word. But yes, in the never of conversation, which means notveryoften, I do think it. For what is to be done in the church? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman is nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The nothing of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as the never. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion.
