I must just speak of it once, I told Sir Thomas I must once, and then I shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.&rdquo; And looking at her complacently, she added, &ldquo;Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side, she presently answered&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear aunt, you cannot wish me to do differently from what I have done, I am sure. You cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me, should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
