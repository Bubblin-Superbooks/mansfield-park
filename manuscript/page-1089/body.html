And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subject of the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. &ldquo;There is no good in this delay,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why is not it settled? He is blinded, and nothing will open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truths before him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor and miserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable!&rdquo; She looked over the letter again.</p></div> </div>
