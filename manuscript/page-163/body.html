You have been an improver yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place in England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham, as it used to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of ground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,&rdquo; was his answer; &ldquo;but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere nothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for improvement, there was very little for me to do&mdash;too little: I should like to have been busy much longer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
