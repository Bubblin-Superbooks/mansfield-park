<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?&rdquo; said Edmund, in a low voice, as his brother approached the fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you in it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it would be very wrong. In a general light, private theatricals are open to some objections, but as we are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling on my father&rsquo;s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely delicate.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
