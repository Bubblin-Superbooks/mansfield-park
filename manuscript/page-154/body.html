It did not suit his sense of propriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put the matter by for the present.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Bertram,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have tidings of my harp at last. I am assured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been these ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary.&rdquo; Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise. &ldquo;The truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant, we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but this morning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher&rsquo;s son-in-law left word at the shop.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
