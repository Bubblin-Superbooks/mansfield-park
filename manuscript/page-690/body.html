Starting and looking up, she saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself, standing at the head of a different staircase. He came towards her. &ldquo;You look tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I have not been out at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had better have gone out.&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance.
