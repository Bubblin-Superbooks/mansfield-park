I understand you&mdash;and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent connexions. What can you want but a decent maintenance? You have not much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means&mdash;but I shall not envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what I have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty is exactly what I have determined against.</p></div> </div>
