<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William&rdquo; (her own cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke). &ldquo;It is not worth minding. It is no reflection on you; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that, you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor&rsquo;s share, like bad weather and hard living, only with this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
