Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these two hours. How can you be tired so soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So soon! my good friend,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with all necessary caution; &ldquo;it is three o&rsquo;clock, and your sister is not used to these sort of hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep as long as you can, and never mind me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
