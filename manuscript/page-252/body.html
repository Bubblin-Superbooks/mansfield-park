Do not you think we have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not half a mile,&rdquo; was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken such a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw directly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in length.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
