<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great want of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;&mdash;on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should be a difference.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
