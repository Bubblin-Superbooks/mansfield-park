<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s character in that point. He wished him to be a model of constancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long.</p><p>Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he wanted to know Fanny&rsquo;s feelings. She had been used to consult him in every difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must be of service to her; whom else had she to open her heart to? If she did not need counsel, she must need the comfort of communication. Fanny estranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things; a state which he must break through, and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through.</p></div> </div>
