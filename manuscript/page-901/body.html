<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her, however, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must be prepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment. She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew she would be very angry with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
