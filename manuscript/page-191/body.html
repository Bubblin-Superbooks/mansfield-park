<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as we do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week, not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.&rdquo;</p><p>Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table, and had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, &ldquo;I must say, ma&rsquo;am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
