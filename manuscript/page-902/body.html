<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dearest Fanny,&rdquo; cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, &ldquo;do not let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talked of rather than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise; I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you should be Henry&rsquo;s wife. And I observed that she always spoke of you as &lsquo;Fanny,&rsquo; which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Grant, did she say&mdash;did she speak; was she there all the time?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
