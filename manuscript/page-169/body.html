<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford now?&rdquo; said Edmund the next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. &ldquo;How did you like her yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play of feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you, Fanny, as not quite right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was quite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
