<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How can two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair&rsquo;s to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are speaking of London, I am speaking of the nation at large.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt.</p></div> </div>
