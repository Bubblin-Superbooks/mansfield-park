Fanny never dines there, you know, in this sort of way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go. Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you put such a question to her,&rdquo; cried Edmund, preventing his cousin&rsquo;s speaking, &ldquo;Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my dear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she should not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She never did before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never asked Fanny.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
