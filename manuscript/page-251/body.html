<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his, &ldquo;how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,&rdquo; turning to Miss Crawford, &ldquo;my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I am not at all tired.&rdquo; She took it, however, as she spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny. &ldquo;You scarcely touch me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You do not make me of any use. What a difference in the weight of a woman&rsquo;s arm from that of a man! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
