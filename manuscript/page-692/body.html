In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,&rdquo; stopping her, by taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, &ldquo;you know what all this means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a kind, kind listener.
