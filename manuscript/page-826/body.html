I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas.</p></div> </div>
