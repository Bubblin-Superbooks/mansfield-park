But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some surmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to you at the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received it just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I remember it perfectly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand? Oh! Miss Crawford, that was not fair.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
