I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault; and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one&rsquo;s power to pay off the debts of one&rsquo;s sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman&rsquo;s nature to refuse such a triumph.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
