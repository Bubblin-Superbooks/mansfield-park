<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And very ungrateful, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt&rsquo;s memory which misleads her here. She is awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral&rsquo;s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not censure her opinions; but there certainly is impropriety in making them public.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
