<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all.&rdquo; And having said so, with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a moment to recover herself. &ldquo;I have had a little fit since I came into this room, as you may perceive,&rdquo; said she presently, with a playful smile, &ldquo;but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point.&rdquo; And embracing her very affectionately, &ldquo;Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
