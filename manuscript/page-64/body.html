<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was another family living actually held for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas&rsquo;s conscience, he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.</p><p>&ldquo;I blush for you, Tom,&rdquo; said he, in his most dignified manner; &ldquo;I blush for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income which ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I hope it will), to procure him better preferment;</p></div> </div>
