<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what&mdash;not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything like it&mdash;but beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay&rdquo; (seeing her draw back displeased), &ldquo;forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo; that I think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
