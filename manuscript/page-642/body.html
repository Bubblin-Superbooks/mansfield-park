<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is the assembly night,&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it, perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner. The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One is nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing fine girls, but they will hardly speak to me, because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
