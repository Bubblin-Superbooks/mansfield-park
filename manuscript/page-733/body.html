Everything that a considerate parent ought to feel was advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother must feel in promoting her children&rsquo;s enjoyment was attributed to her nature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; and at the end of a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s silent consideration spontaneously observed, &ldquo;Sir Thomas, I have been thinking&mdash;and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, &ldquo;Very true. We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face, she is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to her, she is now quite as necessary to us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
