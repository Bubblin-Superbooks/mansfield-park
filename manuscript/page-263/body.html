<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. &ldquo;You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to see you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle&rsquo;s. Your sister loves to laugh.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
