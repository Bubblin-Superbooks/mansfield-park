Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness was wounded by her sister&rsquo;s speech and her mother&rsquo;s reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Susan,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, &ldquo;now, how can you be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish you would not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you to the drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so cross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could but just speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, &lsquo;Let sister Susan have my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.</p></div> </div>
