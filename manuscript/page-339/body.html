It would be taking liberties with my father&rsquo;s house in his absence which could not be justified.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For everything of that nature I will be answerable,&rdquo; said Tom, in a decided tone. &ldquo;His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the breakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister&rsquo;s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute nonsense!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
