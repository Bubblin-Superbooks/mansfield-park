<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Which you suppose has biassed me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that I am sure it has not,&rdquo; cried Fanny.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
