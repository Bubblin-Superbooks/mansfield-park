It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct.
