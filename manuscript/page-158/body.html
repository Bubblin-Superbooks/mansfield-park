<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I shall be most happy to play to you both,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford; &ldquo;at least as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it. And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse will lose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present, foresee any occasion for writing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
