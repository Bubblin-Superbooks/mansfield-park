Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it has been altered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I collect,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, &ldquo;that Sotherton is an old place, and a place of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The house was built in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, and is a large, regular, brick building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It is ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress, and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
