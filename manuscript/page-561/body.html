So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as soon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you please, ma&rsquo;am, on that head; but I meant my father&rsquo;s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation&rsquo;s being accepted or not; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by Fanny, that being the first invitation it should be accepted.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
