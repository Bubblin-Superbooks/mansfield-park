It quite delights me. But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense. I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be angry,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, and in a cooler tone; &ldquo;Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments&rsquo; ill flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten;</p></div> </div>
