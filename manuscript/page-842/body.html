<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits, at present or in future. In all his niece&rsquo;s family and friends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way.</p><p>Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.</p><p>Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity with his niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her disposition he believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should be from one quarter only.</p></div> </div>
