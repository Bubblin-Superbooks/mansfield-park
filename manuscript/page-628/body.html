She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody&rsquo;s striking out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into a place. From being the mere gentleman&rsquo;s residence, it becomes, by judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste, modern manners, good connexions.</p></div> </div>
