<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him. He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities; and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it, for everybody considers it as my doing. &lsquo;Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,&rsquo; said Mrs. Grant the other day, &lsquo;if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
