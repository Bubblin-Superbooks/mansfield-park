<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?&mdash;and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just&mdash;but you know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of yours, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don&rsquo;t say she would be so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable establishment.</p></div> </div>
