<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be sorry, I may be surprised&mdash;though hardly that, for you had not had time to attach yourself&mdash;but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him; nothing could have justified your accepting him.&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.</p><p>&ldquo;So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here. Crawford&rsquo;s is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know, must be a work of time.</p></div> </div>
