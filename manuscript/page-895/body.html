The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect. Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but none so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless. I was playing the fool with my eyes open.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As a bystander,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;perhaps I saw more than you did; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole business.
