<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, &ldquo;I do not like my situation: this place is too hot for me,&rdquo; and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, &ldquo;Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and teasing, but do not let us mind them&rdquo;; and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of being out of spirits herself. By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund&rsquo;s favour.</p></div> </div>
