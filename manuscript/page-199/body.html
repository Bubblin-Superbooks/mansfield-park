His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they had done.

He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding, and very seriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford&rsquo;s, that it should never happen again.</p><p>Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park.
