<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said Henry Crawford, &ldquo;I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not you join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time&mdash;as I shall do&mdash;not to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
