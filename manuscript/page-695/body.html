The time may come&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Dearest Fanny!&rdquo; cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you are all considerate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never come. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it most improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should, there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had.</p></div> </div>
