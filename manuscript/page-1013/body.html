The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert, everybody underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she received from introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladies who approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her coming from a baronet&rsquo;s family, were soon offended by what they termed &ldquo;airs&rdquo;; for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right of superiority.</p></div> </div>
