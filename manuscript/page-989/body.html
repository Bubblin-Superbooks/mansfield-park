Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, and trying to get it away; but the child ran to her mother&rsquo;s protection, and Susan could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidently hoping to interest Fanny on her side. &ldquo;It was very hard that she was not to have her own knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had promised her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
