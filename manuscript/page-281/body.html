<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. &ldquo;Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day&rsquo;s amusement you have had!&rdquo;</p><p>Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, &ldquo;I think you have done pretty well yourself, ma&rsquo;am. Your lap seems full of good things, and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in my lap directly.</p></div> </div>
