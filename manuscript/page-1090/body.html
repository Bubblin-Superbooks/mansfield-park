<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;&lsquo;So very fond of me!&rsquo; &lsquo;tis nonsense all. She loves nobody but herself and her brother. Her friends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have led them astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the less likely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. &lsquo;The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife.&rsquo; I firmly believe it. It is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever. &lsquo;The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.&rsquo; Edmund, you do not know me. The families would never be connected if you did not connect them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end of this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
