<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You spent your time pleasantly there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were all very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with me, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Miss Owens&mdash;you liked them, did not you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
