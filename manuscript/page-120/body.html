Her choice is made.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it is a great match for her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
