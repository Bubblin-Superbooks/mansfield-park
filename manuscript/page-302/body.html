<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can attempt to describe! Here&rsquo;s what may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life. They lose a great deal.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
