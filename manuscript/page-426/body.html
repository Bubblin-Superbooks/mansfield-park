<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,&rdquo; said Mary, after a pause. &ldquo;Do you remember Hawkins Browne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Address to Tobacco,&rsquo; in imitation of Pope?&mdash;</p><p>I will parody them&mdash;</p><p>Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him. He has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house, and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry.</p></div> </div>
