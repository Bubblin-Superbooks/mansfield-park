There you must look for the banners and the achievements.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Rushworth began her relation. &ldquo;This chapel was fitted up as you see it, in James the Second&rsquo;s time. Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
