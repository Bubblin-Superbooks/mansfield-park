<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The ball, too&mdash;such an evening of pleasure before her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well: she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces again, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross. She had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too large for the purpose. His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with delightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross&mdash;those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary&mdash;and put them round her neck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she was able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford&rsquo;s necklace too.</p></div> </div>
