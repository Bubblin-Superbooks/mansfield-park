<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To anything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the utmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at half an hour&rsquo;s notice, whenever she were weary of the place.</p><p>The meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister&rsquo;s husband who looked the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit for everything else.</p></div> </div>
