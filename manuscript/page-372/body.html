<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I cannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell you, that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I hope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary to send you to your father&rsquo;s judgment, I am convinced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We see things very differently,&rdquo; cried Maria. &ldquo;I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it; and I am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
