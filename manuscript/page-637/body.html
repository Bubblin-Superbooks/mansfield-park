May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant?&rdquo;</p><p>Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, &ldquo;It is the only way, sir, in which I could not wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey. Edmund, am I saying too much?&rdquo;</p><p>Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
