Oh! cousin, if I am to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the year. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. Here there are too many whom you can hide behind; but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
