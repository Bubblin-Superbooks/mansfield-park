<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle&rsquo;s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral&rsquo;s. The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly pleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed him an hour&rsquo;s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s would rob her of many hours of his company, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey, to think of anything else.</p></div> </div>
