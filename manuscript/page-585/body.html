<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The most interesting in the world,&rdquo; replied her brother&mdash;&ldquo;how to make money; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I find he takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all for his menusplaisirs; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
