What have you got on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin&rsquo;s marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
