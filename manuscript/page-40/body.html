I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper&mdash;her poor mother had a good deal; but we must make allowances for such a child&mdash;and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it was her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
