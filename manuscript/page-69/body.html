I have always found you a very good girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And am I never to live here again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other.&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.</p></div> </div>
