<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, my good friend, till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager&rsquo;s wife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager&rsquo;s speeches instead of Cottager&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s, and so change the parts all through; he is solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play, and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife&rsquo;s speeches, I would undertake him with all my heart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
