Everybody likes to go their own way&mdash;to chuse their own time and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality, the restraint, the length of time&mdash;altogether it is a formidable thing, and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed, they would have jumped with joy and envy.</p></div> </div>
