They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. &ldquo;Yes, I cannot agree with you there.

That is worse than anything&mdash;quite disgusting!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
