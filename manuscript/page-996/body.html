<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Before the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place, William was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed, and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and during those days she had seen him only twice, in a short and hurried way, when he had come ashore on duty. There had been no free conversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no acquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and depended on. Everything in that quarter failed her, except William&rsquo;s affection. His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped back again to the door to say, &ldquo;Take care of Fanny, mother. She is tender, and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you, take care of Fanny.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
