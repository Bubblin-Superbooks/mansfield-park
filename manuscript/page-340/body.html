<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an expense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a little carpenter&rsquo;s work, and that&rsquo;s all; and as the carpenter&rsquo;s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed, everything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don&rsquo;t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself. Don&rsquo;t act yourself, if you do not like it, but don&rsquo;t expect to govern everybody else.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
