<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s capital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s great hands, she called out, in high good-humour, &ldquo;Sotherton! Yes, that is a place, indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s fine fortune gives them a right to be.</p></div> </div>
