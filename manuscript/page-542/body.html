If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and, moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too quiet for you, I believe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should have thought so theoretically myself, but,&rdquo; and her eyes brightened as she spoke, &ldquo;take it all and all, I never spent so happy a summer. But then,&rdquo; with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, &ldquo;there is no saying what it may lead to.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
