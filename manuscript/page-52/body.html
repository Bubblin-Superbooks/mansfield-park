She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight, and she calls it theIsland, as if there were no other island in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet.</p></div> </div>
