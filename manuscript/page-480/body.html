We were going through the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Our company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour of your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeak your indulgence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My indulgence shall be given, sir,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas gravely, &ldquo;but without any other rehearsal.&rdquo; And with a relenting smile, he added, &ldquo;I come home to be happy and indulgent.&rdquo; Then turning away towards any or all of the rest, he tranquilly said, &ldquo;Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
