With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bonmot, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.&rdquo;</p><p>A general silence succeeded.
