<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, cousin!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere. You will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you very much, Fanny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in it: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the same with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to children. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you must be important to her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
