<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she could not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying something in which the words &ldquo;my aunt Norris&rdquo; were distinguishable.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; cried her uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting to hear more: &ldquo;I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate, and very judiciously, for young people&rsquo;s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on another account, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments have always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have been, and I believe hasbeen, carried too far in your case.</p></div> </div>
