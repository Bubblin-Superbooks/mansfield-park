You have only two scenes, and as I shall be Cottager, I&rsquo;ll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very well, I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea. It would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I should only disappoint you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You&rsquo;ll do it very well. Every allowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must get a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
