<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, very; only I am soon tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you never any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I&rsquo;d dance with you if you would, for nobody would know who I was here, and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about together many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street? I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better.&rdquo; And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, &ldquo;Is not Fanny a very good dancer, sir?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
