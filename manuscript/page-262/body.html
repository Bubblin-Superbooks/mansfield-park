But now, sincerely, do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the truth,&rdquo; speaking rather lower, &ldquo;I do not think that I shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will hardly improve it to me.&rdquo;</p><p>After a moment&rsquo;s embarrassment the lady replied, &ldquo;You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world.
