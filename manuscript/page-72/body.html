<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I can never be important to any one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is to prevent you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly. There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
