<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!&rdquo; said Fanny, in reply. &ldquo;My uncle&rsquo;s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general. The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen! When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence. You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one&rsquo;s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
