<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I am graver than other people,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;The evenings do not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies. I could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains me more than many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I dare say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should you dare say that?&rdquo; (smiling). &ldquo;Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet? But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny?</p></div> </div>
