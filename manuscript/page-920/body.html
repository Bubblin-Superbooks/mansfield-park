She had not foreseen anything of this, and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word &ldquo;last.&rdquo; She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, &ldquo;I hate to leave you. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we shall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear Fanny.&rdquo;</p><p>Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, &ldquo;But you are only going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very particular friend.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
