There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it had been given to me in the first instance,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I should not have thought of returning it; but being her brother&rsquo;s present, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it, when it is not wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its having been originally her brother&rsquo;s gift makes no difference;</p></div> </div>
