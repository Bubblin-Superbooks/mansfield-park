Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
