<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry&rsquo;s eyes, when he comes back, and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake.&rdquo;</p><p>There was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it connected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about whom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week. Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher interest.</p></div> </div>
