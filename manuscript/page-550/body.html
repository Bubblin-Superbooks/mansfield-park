<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!&rdquo; said Miss Crawford archly. &ldquo;Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul&rsquo;s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have me do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often, and never lose your temper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing forth bitter lamentations.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
