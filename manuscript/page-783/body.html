<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Fanny,&mdash;for so I may now always call you, to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at MissPrice for at least the last six weeks&mdash;I cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can be no difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier than he goes.&mdash;Yours affectionately, M. C.&rdquo;</p><p>These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford&rsquo;s meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
