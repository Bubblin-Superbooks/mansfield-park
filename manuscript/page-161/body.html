You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Among admirals, large enough; but,&rdquo; with an air of grandeur, &ldquo;we know very little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort of men, but they do not belong to us. Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my home at my uncle&rsquo;s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears and Vices I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun, I entreat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
