The truth is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice, and you must have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty&mdash;not strikingly pretty&mdash;but &lsquo;pretty enough,&rsquo; as people say; a sort of beauty that grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
