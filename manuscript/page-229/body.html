Fanny&rsquo;s imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of devotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above. &ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice, to Edmund. &ldquo;This is not my idea of a chapel.
