This will be a bad day&rsquo;s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect. Fanny&rsquo;s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
