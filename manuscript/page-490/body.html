I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter&mdash;and this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; so I said, &lsquo;Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be very safe;</p></div> </div>
