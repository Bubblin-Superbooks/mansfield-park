My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months&rsquo; end.&rdquo;</p><p>After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, &ldquo;I know Mansfield, I know its way, I know its faults towards you.
