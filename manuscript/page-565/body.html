<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more natural,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, after a short deliberation; &ldquo;nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything, in my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s niece, could never want explanation. The only surprise I can feel is, that this should be the first time of its being paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
