However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.</p><p>&ldquo;The nonsense and folly of people&rsquo;s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give you a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins&mdash;as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. That will never do, believe me. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to be taking place of her. And as to coming away at night, you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
