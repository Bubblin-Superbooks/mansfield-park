Do not ask advice of me. I am not competent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need not be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few, I imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their conscience. I only want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
