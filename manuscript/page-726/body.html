<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss was given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been very punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.</p><p>After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William&rsquo;s plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s. She sat and cried conamore as her uncle intended, but it was conamore fraternal and no other. William was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.</p></div> </div>
